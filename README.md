### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tanvir

<h1>Welcome to my Github </h1>

I'm an aspiring machine learning and data scientist enthusiast with an extensive background in early stage fintech startups with focus UX/UI Design. I have an undergradute degree in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Sceience in Dubai and post-graduate in Business Analytics from Seneca College. I am graduate in [Applied A.I. Development Solutions](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/applied-ai-solutions-development-program-postgraduate-t431) postgraduate program at George Brown College which helped me began my journey to becoming a Data Scientist.

Working on unique and challenging projects has enhanced my logical thinking capabilities and has enabled me to 'think differently'. As a data analyst, I can analyze complex data, identifying potential risks/opportunities and provide solutions. Something that I like about my domain, is that I get to work with a lot of different people from a wide range of disciplines. This helps my inquisitive nature - I am always curious to gain knowledge from everywhere I can, and I enjoy learning from other's experiences.

I have learnt to apply the skills to identify and collect meaningful data for analysis, conduct analysis of data and present meaningful results to help inform business decisions across the corporate as well as gain international exposure. I will be able to learn how to make decisions based on data and develop softwareâ€™s and applications for data management. This experience will open my career options such as Data Scientist, Business analyst, Data analyst, Machine Learning Engineer, Computer system analyst, Information systems business analyst etc.
